                        along every few metres of the march to protect attendees and assist wherever they can. You can
                        identify them by their purple high-vis vests. Need something? Ask a steward. If they can't help
                        you personally, they should be able to direct you to a team member, medic, or welfare officer
                        who can.

                        masked section of the march, and are happy to support this. Find this zone near the front of the
                        march - we'll have signage to identify where to gather. Stay home if you feel you could be ill

                        or transphobes. Our teams will have been briefed on emergency preparedness in the event of such

                        it will be minimal and hands-off, and that they will prioritise their responsibilities of
                        managing road closures and facilitating traffic safety on the day. Police generally stay close
                        to the very back of the march. If you'd prefer not to have to see or interact with them, we'd
                        suggest avoiding this area.
