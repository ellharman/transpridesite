                London Trans+ Pride (LTP) is a grassroots trans-led community organisation,
                operating as a collective of
                volunteers for and with the trans+ community in the UK. We are responsible for organising the annual
                London Trans+ Pride march since 2018. Our most recent march in 2023 gathered more than 35,000 people
                marching in support of trans+, non-binary, gender non-conforming and intersex lives and made LTP the
                largest trans-focused annual gathering in the UK. At its core, the London Trans+ Pride march is a
                protest. We are calling for equity via positive legislative change and radical improvement to our
                education and public healthcare system to recognise and support the needs of trans+ people as much as
                those of anyone else living in the UK.</p>
            <p class="lg:text-2xl text-5xl leading-snug">
                Since 2018, we have also hosted trans-inclusion workshops for some of our corporate donors. In light of
                the limited, exclusionary and often negative framing of trans+ lives in UK mainstream media, we attempt
                to provide a platform for trans+ voices to be heard and seen as much as possible. Besides our march,
                some
                of the ways we have achieved this so far have been through our combined social media reach of over
                50,000 people, which we use to amplify different trans+ collectives, organisations and individuals;
                community-led research projects as a means of gathering our own data; and using existing platforms, such
                as Glastonbury Festival where we have an annual space, to host workshops, talk to members of the public
                and celebrate some of the best trans+ performers and creatives from London's nightlife scene.

                In 2022 we were honoured to receive the Gay Times Future Fighter Award, which we accepted on behalf of
                the wider trans+ community. We see this award as a reminder that our LGBTQ+ community cannot be divided
                despite growing attempts from so called 'gender-critical' organisations here in the UK.
            </p>
            <p class="lg:text-2xl text-5xl leading-snug">
                Leading up to our fifth year as LTP organisers, we want to use this momentum to expand the scope of our
                work in our attempts to counter the rising hostility towards trans+ people in the UK today. We plan to
                do this through further developing our anti-oppression and trans-inclusive training programme, enhancing
                our community infrastructure provisions, amplifying our campaigning and research capabilities, as well
                as collaborating with partners around strategic litigation.

            <h2 class="lg:text-5xl text-6xl">How we work</h2>
            <p class="lg:text-2xl text-5xl leading-snug">
                Over the past five years our core group has shifted and grown to a team of 12+ volunteers. Our core team
                is entirely trans+, working on a volunteering basis from home, meeting 1-2 times per week in person or
                over Zoom. We each take initiative and responsibility for one key area (community, liaison, events,
                press, marketing & comms, finance) which we work on collectively with any other team member that is
                available and keen to help out. We collectively share responsibilities for organisational development
                and strategy.
            </p>
            <p class="lg:text-2xl text-5xl leading-snug">
                Our governance structure is based on sociocracy (consent of all), while more day-to-day operational
                decisions in need of quick progress are decided democratically (majority vote).
            </p>
            <p class="lg:text-2xl text-5xl leading-snug">
                Any donations and crowdsourced funding thus far have exclusively been used to cover operational expenses
                (excl. staff hours), march organisation and delivery. Exemplary expenses are: speaker fees, producing
                graphic and campaign material, water supply for the march, hiring AV equipment for the march,
                transportation of equipment and venue hire.
