                        identify them by their purple high-vis vests. Need something? Ask a steward. If they can't help
                        you personally, they should be able to direct you to a team member, medic, or welfare officer

                        march - we'll have signage to identify where to gather. Stay home if you feel you could be ill

                        it will be minimal and hands-off, and that they will prioritise their responsibilities of
                        managing road closures and facilitating traffic safety on the day. Police generally stay close
                        to the very back of the march. If you'd prefer not to have to see or interact with them, we'd
                        suggest avoiding this area.

In front of that, towards the arch, is the access slope, for people who use BSL and/or have access needs but are happy to sit on a grassy slope. In front of that is the access area, which is located right in front of the arch. There is a yellow flag on the right side of this area, marking the location of the stage. The BSL interpreters will be stationed on the left side of the stage. Behind the arch, at the intersection of Grosvenor Place and Grosvenor Crescent, is the chill and family friendly area. To the right, in front of the Royal Artillery Memorial, a yellow flag marks accessible toilets and the first aid station, as well as an ambulance, and service dog refreshment area. On the east side of the square, in front of the Statue of the Duke of Wellington, a yellow flag marks the hydration station and the meeting point for people who have been separated.">
